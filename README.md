## Prerequisites

Before running the application locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 23
- Docker (for containerization)
- Maven (for dependency management)
- SQLite (database)
- An active account on Render (for deployment)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/S-arpCoders/BankApp.git
cd BankApp
```

### 2. Build the application

Using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Configure SQLite Database

SQLite is used as the database for this app. Ensure that the database file is created and configured correctly.

The app may automatically create it when it runs for the first time.

### 4. Run the application locally

To run the app locally without Docker, use:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 5. Docker Setup

If you prefer to run the application using Docker, follow these steps:

- Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t BankApp .
```

- Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 BankApp
```

### 6. Access the application

Once the app is running, access it in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Features in Detail

### Authentication

- Users can register with a unique username and password.
- The app uses Http Session to handle authentication, with session management through cookies.

- Each account can hold a balance, and transactions can be performed between accounts.

### Transactions

- **Transaction History**: View all transactions associated with a particular account.

### Session Handling
